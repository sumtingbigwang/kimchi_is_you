Sprites and level designs from the BABA IS YOU game by Arvi "Hempuli" Teikari. 

Credit:
- Claude / Cursor fixed (code was previously originally written but didn't work) the following functions:
    - moveObj, pushObj, canPushObj (fixed recursion on objects in long chains)
    - calculateGridDimensions (implemented feature to adjust grid sizing according to window size changes)
    - drawGame (added module to draw players on top of objects)

- Tyler Yang suggested idea of storing maps in dicts instead of lists and a big ass 3D list.
